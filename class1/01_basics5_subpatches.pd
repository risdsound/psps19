#X text 352 37 This subpatch does nothing \, except pass the data in
and then out. Notice that there are two kinds of inlets and outlets
here. Ones with the ~ sign and ones without. This is an important distinction
that we'll get to later. The ~ sign marks the difference between an
object that works with audio signals vs. those that work control data.
You'll notice that the line connecting the audio signal objects is
bold. This is another way to tell the difference between control and
audio.;

#X text 309 305 For many of the examples to follow \, there will be
subpatches nested within parent patches. Just click these in Play mode
to see the contents. Try making your own subpatch with inlets and outlets.
Subpatches help to keep things readable.;
#X text 310 154 SUBPATCHES. In Pd you can make a subpatch with an object
called "pd." You simply create a new object called "pd" with a creation
argument of whatever you'd like to call the subpatch. To see the contents
\, just click once on it in Play mode.;
