#X text 99 103 Pd (Pure Data) is a visual programming language \, sometimes
called a dataflow language. It allows you to patch together "objects"
to make your own programs. Each object is a bit of C code that functions
like a "black box machine." When patching \, you only need to worry
about the input and output of these objects (which we could also call
functions and are often called "externals" by the Max & Pd community).
;
#X text 40 287 Pd runs in "real-time \, " meaning that you do not need
to compile the program for it to run. In Pd you can be in one of two
modes: edit or run/execute.;
#X text 542 160 There are many objects inlcuded with Pd and even more
that you can install using the package manager (under Help > Find externals).
You can even code objects yourself. Objects are mostly written in C
\, which means that Pd patches can be translated into C for use in
various types of software development. You can also create your own
libraries of "abstractions" which are sub-patches you plan to use alot.
These work like objects \, but are created with Pd.;
#X text 415 419 Pd was created by Miller Puckette in the mid-90s \,
as an open source project. It is a part of a family of patcher programming
languages \, the most famous of which is it's commercial cousin Max/MSP
(Cycling '74). Notably \, Miller is the author of the original Max
program developed in the 1980s. The program 'Max' was named for Max
Mathews. Max Mathews' Music N languages were the basis for many of
today's computer music programming languages.;
