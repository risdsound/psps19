#X text 204 39 In the Edit menu \, you'll notice the familiar commands
of Cut \, Copy \, and Paste. You can use these operations in your patches.
This is very useful \, let's say \, when you want to grab something
out of a help patch and copy it into your own patch. Simply highlight
the objects you want in Edit mode and Cut/Copy/Paste as desired. This
type of editing can also be a time saver for copying elements within
your patch --- however you'll generally want to use the Duplicate command
in this instance. Partly because \, sometimes the Copy/Paste combo
can place things strangely and partly because the Duplicate command
is just one step faster. Try both on the objects below \, then try
using Copy/Paste from the help patch of metro. Keep in mind that if
you modify a help patch - don't save it!;
#X text 491 369 Note: Good patching practice is to arrange your objects
so that the dataflow is from the top-down \, and from right-to-left.
Avoid connecting-lines overlapping objects as much as possible (for
the sake of readability).;
