#X text 141 87 There are the two modes for working in Pd. You switch
between these modes by clicking ctrl-E (PC) or command-E (Mac). When
you switch modes you should see the cursor change from a hand (Edit
mode) to an arrow (Play mode). Sometimes it's hard to remember which
mode you are in. Just remember to take a look at the cursor to tell
you which mode is active \, and always remember that after you use
the ctrl-E command \, the cursor doesn't change its appearance till
you move it. In Edit mode \, you should be able to move this text around
\, click on it and add to it. In play mode \, this text is unmoveable.
Try it!;

under the Media menu. Make sure an input and output device are selected.
For now \, now let's check that you have both "built-in" options selected.
Once you've check that \, you can try the Test Audio and MIDI patch
\, also under the Media menu.;
