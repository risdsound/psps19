#X text 215 128 "An instrument that uses computer-generated sound can
be called a digital music instrument (DMI) and consists of a control
surface or gestural controller \, which drives the musical parameters
of a sound synthesizer in real time." (Miranda and Wanderley. 2006
New Digital Musical Instruments. A-R Editions \, Inc.);
#X text 475 269 In this class \, we'll be exploring DMI design. We'll
be building audio software and electronic circuits that will let us
map gestural control to changes in sound. We'll also cover using off-the-shelf
interfaces (like MIDI control surfaces and keyboards).;
