#X text 229 101 <- to get sound out to your speakers \, you will need
the dac~ object. The dac~ is the Digital to Analog Converter. This
enables the computer to take our digital information and send it to
an amplfier/loudspeaker combination where it is converted to analog
pressure waves that we can hear. Notice the ~ sign at the end of the
object name. This indicates that this object works with audio signals.

#X text 367 445 <- just as we have a dac~ \, we also have an adc~ (Analog
to Digital Converter). This allows us to take an an audio input (line
or microphone input) and convert it into digital information that can
be processed in Pd.;
