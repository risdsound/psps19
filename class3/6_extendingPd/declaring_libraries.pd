#X text 516 45 On a Mac \, when Pd was installed it should have created
a directory called "Pd" in your Documents folder. We'll confirm where
this is on Windows in class. You can add new main folder paths by choosing
the menu item: Pd > Preferences > Path. In this way \, you can load
abstractions into any Pd patch you are working on.;
#X text 16 65 I made a folder called "psps" in my Documents/Pd folder
and have these abstractions inside.;
#X text 462 266 To ensure compatibility for others \, copy your abstractions
to the same folder as your patch. If using a subfolder to organize
these \, then still use the [declare] object.;

of external libraries won't work when we run Pd patches on mobile devices
in a few weeks.;
